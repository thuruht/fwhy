  title: "Event Title",
  date: "2025-06-20", 
  time: "19:00",
  venue: "farewell|howdy",
  description: "Event description",
  suggestedPrice: "$15",
  ticketLink: "https://tickets.example.com",
  flyerUrl: "https://cdn.example.com/flyer.jpg",
  flyerThumbnail: "https://cdn.example.com/thumb.jpg",
  source: "batch-upload",
  created: "ISO-8601-timestamp",
  updated: "ISO-8601-timestamp"
}
```

### 5. Popup System Enhancement
